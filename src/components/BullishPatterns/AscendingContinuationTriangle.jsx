          An Ascending Continuation Triangle is considered a bullish signal. It
          indicates a possible continuation of the current uptrend.

        <p>
          An ascending continuation triangle shows two converging trendlines.
          The lower trendline is rising and the upper trendline is horizontal.
          This pattern occurs because the lows are moving increasingly higher
          but the highs are maintaining a constant price level. The pattern will
          have two highs and two lows, all touching the trendlines. This pattern
          is confirmed when the price breaks out of the triangle formation to
          close above the upper trendline.

        <p>
          Volume is an important factor to consider. Typically, volume follows a
          reliable pattern: volume should diminish as the price swings back and
          forth between an increasingly narrow range of highs and lows. However,
          when breakout occurs, there should be a noticeable increase in volume.
          If this volume picture is not clear, investors should be cautious
          about decisions based on this Triangle.

            <strong className="text-gray-500">Occurrence of a Breakout:</strong>
            Technical analysts pay close attention to how long the Triangle
            takes to develop to its apex. The general rule is that prices should
            break out - clearly penetrate one of the trendlines - somewhere
            between three-quarters and two-thirds of the horizontal width of the
            formation. The breakout should occur well before the pattern reaches
            the apex of the Triangle. The closer the breakout occurs to the
            apex, the less reliable the formation.

          <li className="pb-4">
            <strong className="text-gray-500">Duration of the Triangle:</strong>{" "}
            The Triangle is a relatively short-term pattern. It may take between
            one and three months to form.
          </li>
          <li className="pb-4">
            <strong className="text-gray-500">Shape of Triangle:</strong> The
            horizontal top trendline need not be completely horizontal but it
            should be close to horizontal.
          </li>
          <li className="pb-4">
            <strong className="text-gray-500">Volume:</strong> Investors should
            see volume decreasing as the pattern progresses toward the apex of
            the Triangle. At breakout, however, there should be a noticeable
            increase in volume.

          Trading Considerations

          <li className="pb-4">
            <strong className="text-gray-500">Duration of the Pattern:</strong>{" "}
            Consider the duration of the pattern and its relationship to your
            trading time horizons. The duration of the pattern is considered to
            be an indicator of the duration of the influence of this pattern.
            The longer the pattern, the longer it will take for the price to
            move to the target price. The shorter the pattern, the sooner the
            price move. If you are considering a short-term trading opportunity,
            look for a pattern with a short duration. If you are considering a
            longer-term trading opportunity, look for a pattern with a longer
            duration.
          </li>
          <li className="pb-4">
            <strong className="text-gray-500">Target Price:</strong> The target
            price provides an important indication about the potential price
            move that this pattern indicates. Consider whether the target price
            for this pattern is sufficient to provide adequate returns after
            your costs (such as commissions) have been taken into account. A
            good rule of thumb is that the target price must indicate a
            potential return of greater than 5% before a pattern should be
            considered useful. However, you must consider the current price and
            the volume of shares you intend to trade. Also, check that the
            target price has not already been achieved.
          </li>
          <li className="pb-4">
            <strong className="text-gray-500">Inbound Trend:</strong> The
            inbound trend is an important characteristic of the pattern. A
            shallow inbound trend may indicate a period of consolidation before
            the price move indicated by the pattern begins. Look for an inbound
            trend that is longer than the duration of the pattern. A good rule
            of thumb is that the inbound trend should be at least two times the
            duration of the pattern.

            duration of the pattern. In addition, the volume during the duration

            The lack of a volume spike on the day of the pattern confirmation is
            an indication that this pattern may not be reliable. In addition, if

            duration of the pattern, then this pattern should be considered less

            indicates that buyers are more aggressive than sellers. The pattern
            forms because a supply of shares is available at a fixed price. When
            the supply depletes, the shares quickly break out from the top
            trendline and move higher.
